# Project 1 - COVID DATA ANALYSIS & VISUALIZATION 
As a new data analyst, I analyzed the Covid-19 data for the year 2020 and 201, to check the indicators such as number of people affected in each country and continent. This data also helps to provide the percentage of population affected per country. The tools used are SQL and Tableau.
